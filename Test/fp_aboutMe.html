		<p>Hi, I'm Brian. I'm 22 years old and I'm from Brooklyn New York. I'm a computer science major at Brooklyn College,
		with hopes of becoming a software engineer or something in the cyber security field.
		As I'm sure you can tell by now, one of my favorite hobbies is 3D printing. I love the whole process from tuning, calibration even 
		maintence. I enjoy working with mechanical things especially the computer guided types such as 3D printers and CNC routers.
		I love being able to create something out of what seems like a giant spool of plastic.
		</p>
		<h2>Below is A schedule for frinting a helmet and how I devide each piece since it can sometimes take a day or more to print one of them. And about a week for the whole thing not including post processing for painting.</h2>
