    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <div class="aboutMe">
        <p class="hi">Hi, I'm Brian!</p>
        <p>I'm a senior computer science major at Brooklyn College and a data science fellow at CUNY Tech Prep.</p>
        <p class="main">I'm passionate about technology and technical challenges. I aspire to become a machine learning engineer to contribute to the technical advancement of artificial intelligence and to expand its applications and effectiveness in existing fields. I also enjoy working on side projects involving embedded systems using Raspberry Pis and Arduino. Including the occasional project involving 3D printing. Outside of technology, I love working out, reading non-fiction, hiking (when the weather's nice), and going to EDM music festivals and live shows. I hope you enjoyed my portfolio site!</p>
