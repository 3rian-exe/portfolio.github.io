            Hi, I'm Brian!
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm a senior computer science major at Brooklyn College, a data science fellow at CUNY Tech Prep, and a software development intern at the Brooklyn Navy Yard Development Corpporation.
        </p>
        <p class="main">
            I'm passionate about technology and technical challenges. I enjoy working on projects involving single board computers and embedded systems such as the Raspberry Pi, Raspberry Pi Pico, ESP32 and Arduino. Including the occasional project involving 3D printing. Outside of technology, I love working out, reading non-fiction, and hiking when the weather's nice. Enjoy my portfolio!
